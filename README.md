# Linear Regression with scikit-learn

This repository contains a Python script for implementing linear regression using scikit-learn. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more independent features.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/*****/linear-regression.git
cd linear-regression
```

2. Run the script:

```bash
python linear_regression.py
```

Make sure to update the file paths in the script to point to your actual dataset files.

## Algorithm

The script uses the scikit-learn library to implement linear regression. You can experiment with other regression algorithms by replacing the `LinearRegression` model with the desired model from scikit-learn.

For example, to use Decision Tree Regression:

```python
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

# Create a Decision Tree Regression model
model = DecisionTreeRegressor()
# ... rest of the code remains the same
```

## Results

The script calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R^2) scores for both the training and test sets. The results are printed, and a plot is generated to visualize the regression line and actual data points.
